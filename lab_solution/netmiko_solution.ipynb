    "\n",
    "### Building blocks of Netmiko python script\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab exercise you will learn how a basic netmiko python script is constructed. Think of it like a Lego block, first we will start with basic building blocks and quickly iterate through it to build complex programming logics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s dive into the basic building blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we have to import the Netmiko connection libraries\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from netmiko import Netmiko\n",
    "```\n",
    "The connection parameters are collected in a Python dictionary. The connection parameters provide Netmiko with everything it needs to create the SSH connection. In the below example we have shown how to connect to a IOS device, if it is a NXOS device, simply change the device type to 'device_type': 'cisco_nxos'.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ios1 = {\n",
    "    'device_type': 'cisco_ios',\n",
    "    'ip': '172.16.1.11',\n",
    "    'username': 'cisco',\n",
    "    'password': 'cisco',\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Netmiko is a function that calls the necessary connection parameters and device type (cisco_ios, cisco_xr, cisco_nxos, etc.) Once connection parameters are loaded, the script will launch a SSH connection to login into the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "net_connect = Netmiko(**ios1)\n",
    "```\n",
    ".send_command() method is used to send show commands over the channel and receive the output back. Here, we are reading the output of ‘show version’ command and storing it in a variable named 'output'.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "output = net_connect.send_command('show version’)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using the .send_config_set() method, we can program the network device to enter into configuration mode and make configuration changes. After executing the config_commands the script will exit the configuration mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "output = net_connect.send_config_set(config_commands)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can send either only one command or multiple lines of commands by converting it into a simple list. If we are sending a big configuration, it is recommended to use the .send_config_from_file() method. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "output = net_connect.send_config_from_file('more_config')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the session output is stored in an output variable and then printed out in the screen for our reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on the all the connection methods avaialvle with Netmiko, pls refer the documentation\n",
